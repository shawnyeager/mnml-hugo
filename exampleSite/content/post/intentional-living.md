We drift through life on autopilot, responding to demands, following routines, checking boxes. But what if we paused to ask: Is this what I actually want?

Intentional living means making conscious choices about how you spend your time, energy, and attention. It's the opposite of going through the motions.

## Start with Values

You can't live intentionally without knowing what matters to you. Take time to identify your core values. Not what you think should matter, but what actually does.

Write them down. Mine are: creativity, growth, connection, health, and simplicity. Yours will be different. That's the point.

## Audit Your Life

Look at how you actually spend your time:
- Track your time for a week
- Review your calendar and commitments
- Check your screen time stats

Does how you spend your time reflect your values? For most people, the answer is uncomfortable. That's okay. Awareness is the first step.

## Say No More Often

Every yes to something is a no to something else. When you say yes to scrolling social media, you're saying no to reading that book. When you say yes to another meeting, you're saying no to focused work.

Protecting your time means saying no—a lot. To good opportunities, not just bad ones.

## Create Systems

Willpower is finite. Systems are reliable. Want to exercise regularly? Schedule it like an appointment. Want to read more? Keep a book by your bed and read three pages before sleep.

Intentional living doesn't require superhuman discipline. It requires smart systems.

## Review Regularly

Life changes. Values evolve. What worked last year might not work now. Schedule regular reviews—monthly or quarterly—to assess whether your actions align with your intentions.

## The Payoff

Intentional living is harder than autopilot. It requires thought, discipline, and sometimes uncomfortable choices. But the alternative is spending your life as a passenger, watching it pass by through the window.

You get one life. Live it on purpose.
