We make thousands of decisions every day. What to wear, what to eat, what to work on first. Each decision depletes our mental energy, leaving less for what matters.

The solution? Reduce decision-making through intelligent automation and constraints.

## Decision Fatigue is Real

Research shows that our decision-making quality deteriorates throughout the day. That's why judges are more likely to grant parole in the morning than afternoon. It's not about fairness—it's about mental fatigue.

Every trivial decision you make is one less decision you can make well later.

## Strategies to Reduce Decisions

### 1. Uniform Wardrobe

Steve Jobs wore the same outfit daily. Not because he lacked creativity, but because he saved it for more important things. Consider creating a personal uniform or a capsule wardrobe.

### 2. Default Meals

Have standard breakfasts and lunches. Variety can be reserved for dinner. I eat the same breakfast every day. One less decision before I've had coffee.

### 3. Routinize the Routine

Create standard responses to recurring situations:
- Default meeting times
- Standard email templates
- Set exercise schedule
- Regular bedtime and wake time

### 4. Batch Similar Tasks

Make all similar decisions at once. Schedule all meetings on specific days. Process all emails in designated time blocks. Write multiple blog posts in one session.

### 5. Use If-Then Rules

Create automatic responses to common scenarios:
- If invited to an event more than a week away, check calendar immediately
- If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it now
- If feeling stuck on work, take a 5-minute walk

## The Benefits

Reducing trivial decisions creates space for important ones. You'll have more energy for creative work, strategic thinking, and meaningful relationships.

## But Don't Eliminate All Decisions

Some decisions are worth savoring. Trying new restaurants. Planning vacations. Choosing books to read. The goal isn't to remove all decision-making—it's to be intentional about where you spend your decision-making energy.

Automate the trivial to empower the important.
