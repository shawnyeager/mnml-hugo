Good writing is simple writing. Not simplistic, but simpleâ€”clear, direct, and purposeful. Every word should earn its place on the page.

## Write for One Person

Imagine you're writing to a specific person. Not "the audience" or "readers in general," but one real person you know. This mental shift transforms abstract writing into concrete communication.

## Cut Ruthlessly

First drafts are always too long. That's fine. The magic happens in revision. Ask yourself with every sentence: Does this add value? If you can cut a word without losing meaning, cut it.

### Before:
"In order to improve your writing skills, it is necessary to practice on a regular basis."

### After:
"To write better, practice regularly."

## Use Active Voice

Passive voice obscures action and responsibility. Active voice is clearer and more engaging.

- Passive: "The blog post was written by Sarah."
- Active: "Sarah wrote the blog post."

## Short Sentences Work

They're punchy. Easy to read. They create rhythm. They give readers a break. Use them.

## Read Aloud

Your ears catch what your eyes miss. If something sounds awkward when spoken, it will read awkwardly. Good writing has rhythm.

## The Best Writing is Rewriting

Hemingway wrote 39 drafts of the ending to *A Farewell to Arms*. Even if you're writing a blog post, not a novel, the principle holds: writing is rewriting.

Start messy. End clear. That's the process.
