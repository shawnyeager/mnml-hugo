### Adding a Search Page

**mnml** has a built-in Search shortcode to let you add a Search page if you so desire...

1. Create a new Micro.blog page. Name it whatever you like with a url of whatever you like.
2. In the page body, add the ``{{< search >}}`` shortcode.
3. Visit your new search page and try it out.

Note: Search results default to 5 until you set your own value in the **mnml** plugin settings page.
